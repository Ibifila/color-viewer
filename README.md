# color-viewer
I'm following John Smilga's tutorial on JavaScript with 15 Vanilla projects.
The first project is a color flipper, so I created my own version as a color viewer.
It allows a user to enter a color name or code and it will display that color.
The major lessons from this is changing the style property of html elements from JavaScript.
